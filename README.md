## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
Navigate your cat through the maze to catch mice, birds, fish, and other prey. Each time you catch prey, you'll need to solve a math problem to score points!

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** - Move the cat
- **Space Bar** - Activate speed boost
- **Enter** - Submit math answers

### Game Mechanics

1. **Hunting Phase**: Move your cat through the maze to catch prey (🐭 mice, 🐦 birds, 🐟 fish, 🦎 lizards, 🐛 bugs)

2. **Speed Boosts**: Collect ⚡ lightning bolts scattered in the maze!
   - Maximum of 3 boosts can be collected per level
   - Press **SPACE** to activate a 2-second speed burst
   - Use strategically to catch prey or escape the dog!

3. **Math Challenge**: When you catch prey, a math problem appears:
   - Solve it correctly → Score points based on prey type and level!
   - Solve it wrong → Dog chase begins!

3. **Dog Chase**: If you answer incorrectly, an angry dog 🐕 will chase you for 10 seconds!
   - Survive without getting caught to return to hunting
   - If caught, you lose a life

4. **Level Progression**: Catch all prey to advance to the next level with:
   - More prey to catch
   - Faster enemies
   - Harder math problems

### Scoring
| Prey | Points |
|------|--------|
| 🐛 Bug | 5 |
| 🐭 Mouse | 10 |
| 🐦 Bird | 15 |
| 🐟 Fish | 20 |
